# DrawingSapiens
Ah~ Power of a pen~ inside my body~ (A open source illustrate software)

# The target of the project
A user-friendly illustrate software.

# All api I have tested
- pyglet (Surface pen is not supported
- pyqt5 (Can't run normally on my devices)
- cgkit (Need python 3.3, so I not intend to use it)
- pySide2 (I have not enough space to install MSVC, so delayed)
